This small library provides a simple and easy to use interface for creating, sending and receiving HTTP requests and responses. Although many of the concepts of the PSR-7 standard are present in this library, it is not intended to seek compatibility with that recommendation.

## Installation
The installation of this library can be done with Composer:
```composer require mk4u/http```
